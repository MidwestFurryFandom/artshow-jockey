Artshow-Jockey - Art Show Management Software
Copyright (c) 2009,2010 Chris Cogdon

Installation
------------

This is a Django application. Install Django by following the standard Django instructions
and create a new project. Copy the "artshow" directory from this installation into
your project (or symlink from there to here) and make the following modifications
to the top-level files:

to urls.py, urlpatters, add:

	(r'^artshow/', include ( 'yourprojectname.artshow.urls' ) ),

you should also enable django's administration interface, if you haven't already,
as Artshow Jockey relies heavily on it.

to settings.py, TEMPLATE_DIRS, add:

	"/full/path/to/yourprojectname/artshow/templates/",

to settings.py, INSTALLED_APPS, add:

	"yourprojectname.artshow',

and add the following to settings.py as well, with appropriate mods:

ARTSHOW_SHOW_NAME = "MY AWESOME ART SHOW"
ARTSHOW_TAX_RATE = "0.0925"
ARTSHOW_TAX_DESCRIPTION = "%9.25 CA TAX"

Once all that's done, you should be able to go ./manage.py syncdb and get everything set up.

Setting up the data
-------------------

First thing you'll want to do is add some space types so you can allocate spaces.
