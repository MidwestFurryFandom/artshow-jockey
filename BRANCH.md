peeps branch details
====================

This branch splits out the "Person" abstract class into its own app called "peeps".

The intent is to easily facilitate linking Artshow Jockey to another application
that also deals with People: perhaps an existing convention database.

The "peeps" app is provided as a simple database to provide the necessary functionality.

This will, of course, be merged into master once completely tested.
